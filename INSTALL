Installing Wikkid Wiki
======================

Hopefully we'll get this packaged for at least Ubuntu and Debian, and some
setup tools for those that like it like that.

Dependancies
------------

python-twisted or the twisted.web libraries
bzr for the filestore and merging
python-jinja2 for the templating
python-lazr.enum for lazr.enum
