Installing Wikkid Wiki
======================

Hopefully we'll get this packaged for at least Ubuntu and Debian, and some
setup tools for those that like it like that.

Dependancies
------------

python-zope.interface for the interfaces
python-twisted or the twisted.web libraries
bzr for the filestore and merging
python-jinja2 for the templating
python-docutils for the ReST formatter
python-testtools - for running the test suite (optional)
python-beautifulsoup - for testing of html (soon)
python-pygments - for the syntax hilighting
