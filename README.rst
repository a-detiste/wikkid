Wikkid is a wiki that uses Git or Bazaar as a way to store the content.

Principles of Wikkid

* Will run using any Git_ or Bazaar_ branch, not just one it has created
* Provides a Breezy plugin to simplify the serving of a branch
* When run locally Wikkid will use the current users configured identity
* Can be used as a public facing wiki with multiple users
* Can be used as a library in other Python_ applications
