A location for general notes
============================

* Really should have a way to decouple the url generation from the
Server class and the views themselves.  Probably want something like
a method that takes a model object, and view class and generates an URL.

* I have a feeling, just gut mainly, that we should have a model package,
with different types of model objects like, WikiResource, TextResource,
BinaryResource, DirectoryResource and MissingResource.  These different
model objects can then have views upon them.  Classic model/view/controller
with the controller being the Server class.
