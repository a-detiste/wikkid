A location for general notes
============================

* Really should have a way to decouple the url generation from the
  Server class and the views themselves.  Probably want something like
  a method that takes a model object, and view class and generates an URL.

* Add a nice error page instead of the twisted.web error page.

* Add in a file id for text editing so we can track edits during page moves

* Add in the ability to move pages

* Add markdown and textile formatters


Ideas not yet fully formed
--------------------------

* Lazy loading of formatters (to reduce install dependancies)

* Customize default rendering engine

* Extend creole to allow specifying format of embedded code

* Look for a wiki-media python library for formatting wiki-media text
  Or write one.
