A location for general notes
============================

* Really should have a way to decouple the url generation from the
  Server class and the views themselves.  Probably want something like
  a method that takes a model object, and view class and generates an URL.

* General URL traversal:
  * /path/to/file always represents a server resource, missing or otherwise
  * ?view=XXX gets the defined view for the object, like view, edit, raw, diff
  * ?action=XXX causes something to happen to the resource, like save, move
